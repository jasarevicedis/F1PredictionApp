# 🏎️ F1 Tyre Strategy Predictor

This project is a machine learning-powered application that predicts Formula 1 tyre strategies using [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) data. It includes a backend for data fetching and model training, and a web interface (coming soon) for interactive predictions.
